# Flutter Studio
## Interactive run-time dart code generator app for flutter widgets.

Flutter studio started as an idea at the first ever International Flutter Hackathon. The goal of this idea is to help make flutter as fast and easy to learn as possible for beginners as well as seasoned flutter developers.

The interactive UI offers a range of widgets to choose from which can be viewed on the canvas board. As the user adds new widgets to the canvas, the corresponding Dart code for the widget tree is seamlessly generated at run time in code preview window.

This code can be - 
- Saved to local device storage as a `.dart` file
- Copied to the clipboard
- Shared via a range of third party apps

## Note
The current version of this app was onl prepared for demo purpose within a short span of 6 hours, and hence for now, only the following basic material widgets are supported -
1. Default `Scaffold`
2. Default `AppBar`
3. `Center` widget
4. `Text` widget with pre-defined text
5. Deafult `FloatingActionButton`

> **Over time, support for more widgets will be added to the app and any contributions, ideas, comments or suggestions are more than welcome!**

Feel free to fork the project and try out your hands with flutter development! Let's build something great together!
